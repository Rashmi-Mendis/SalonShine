# SalonShine

🎨 Excited to share my latest design work — the UI design for "Salon Shine", a mobile app created for easy and efficient beauty salon bookings! 💇‍♀️💅
This was a group project for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) module at Rajarata University of Sri Lanka. While the full project was a collaborative effort, I was solely responsible for the entire UI/UX design — from low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes — using Figma.

🧠 The rest of my amazing team handled:
 ✔️ Prototyping
 ✔️ User research and persona development
 ✔️ Usability testing using Maze
 ✔️ Documentation, analysis, and applying HCI principles

📱 Key Screens I Designed:
 ✔️ Logo & Onboarding Pages
 ✔️ Login/Register
 ✔️ Home & Service Pages
 ✔️ Real-time Booking UI
Profile & Password Reset

✨ Design Focus:
 ✔️ Clean navigation with consistent icons
 ✔️ Real-time appointment booking UX
 ✔️ Soft pink palette for a friendly, welcoming aesthetic
 ✔️ Accessibility and mobile responsiveness
 ✔️ This project taught me a lot about user-centered design and the value of strong teamwork, and I’m proud of the polished and purposeful interface we built together!

👩‍💻 Tools: Figma, Maze
 📚 Methods: Wireframing, prototyping, heuristic evaluation
